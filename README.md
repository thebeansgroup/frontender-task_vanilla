# Frontender Task

This repo contains a lo-fi, half-built, unstyled ES6 JS app. Your task is to complete the project to match the mockups below.

To complete, you'll need to:

1. Fork this repo and commit your work into the fork. Once you are complete, create a pull request back into this repo.
2. Create JS classes for the `Comments` section of the app. Use the `Event` section as a template. Vanilla JS.
3. Create CSS for the page. Do not use an existing framework, keep it light`weight. Think about efficiency.
